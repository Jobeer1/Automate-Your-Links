# Automate-Your-Links

Automate simple tasks

Automate Your Links is a tool designed to simplify the process of linking the output of one machine learning model to the input of another, automating repetitive tasks and making complex workflows more efficient.

## Features

* Seamless integration between different ML models
* Automates tasks like copying and pasting outputs
* User-friendly interface (with future improvements planned)
* Supports open-source and proprietary models
* Can be run in the background on a virtual machine for independent operation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed
* Git installed (for cloning the repository)

### Installation

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Jobeer1/Automate-Your-Links.git](https://github.com/Jobeer1/Automate-Your-Links.git)
   cd Automate-Your-Links
````

2.  Install Dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Application

You can run the Python script directly:

```bash
python Automation.py
```

### Running in the Background (Virtual Machine)

For optimal performance and to allow the automation to run independently of your own mouse and keyboard actions, it's recommended to run this application within a virtual machine.  This allows the automation to function in the background while you use your computer for other tasks.

1.  **Install VirtualBox:** Download and install VirtualBox from [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.virtualbox.org/).

2.  **Download Kali Linux:** Download the Kali Linux ISO image from [https://www.kali.org/downloads](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.kali.org/downloads).  (Kali Linux is a suitable operating system for running the automation, but other Linux distributions or even Windows can be used).

3.  **Create a Virtual Machine:** Create a new virtual machine in VirtualBox, using the downloaded Kali Linux ISO image as the installation media.

4.  **Install Dependencies (within VM):** Once Kali Linux is installed in the VM, open a terminal and install the necessary Python dependencies:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update  # Update package lists
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip  # Install Python and pip
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt # Install the project's requirements
    ```

5.  **Run the Application (within VM):** Navigate to the project directory within the VM and run the script:

    ```bash
    python3 Automation.py
    ```

Now, the automation tasks will run within the virtual machine, even if you minimize the VM window or work on other applications on your host PC.

```

**Key Changes:**

* **Virtual Machine Section:** Added a clear section explaining how to run the application in a virtual machine for background operation.
* **Download Links:** Included direct links to VirtualBox and Kali Linux downloads, making it easier for users to set up their VM environment.
* **Instructions for VM:** Provided step-by-step instructions for installing dependencies and running the script *within* the virtual machine.
* **Emphasis on Independence:** Highlighted the benefit of running the automation in a VM to achieve independent mouse/keyboard control.
* **Minor formatting improvements:** Made some formatting tweaks for better readability.

This updated README provides comprehensive instructions for running the application, including the crucial information about using a virtual machine for background operation.  This will make it much easier for others to use your tool effectively.
